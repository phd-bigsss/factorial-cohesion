## Theoretical perspectives on social cohesion

### Social Cohesion 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
* It can be understood as a state of affairs relating to interactions: **vertical** (between the state and its citizens and organizations) and **horizontal** (between individuals and groups in society).
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
> (..) characterized by a set of attitudes and norms that include trust, a sense of belonging, and a willingness to participate and help, as well as their behavioral manifestations [@chan_reconsidering_2006]. 
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
* Identifying shared and (i) **conflicting interests**, (ii) **goals**, and (iii) **values** leads to the identification of opportunities for cooperation motivated by bonds of trust and support within your local or national community.[@green_regimes_2011].

## Theoretical perspectives on social cohesion

### Cohesion between and within groups

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
Additionally, these attitudinal and behavioral expressions contribute to the formation of social groups :

> (…) defined by a combination of socioeconomic position (vertical stratification) and shared cultural values (horizontal value space)  [@groh-samberg_social_2023]
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}

From this perspective, individuals are integrated into social groups, and these are integrated (more or less) into society.  

* **Internal cohesion**: similarity can promotes trust, consensus, and cooperation. 

* **Intergroup cohesion**: existence of ties between groups and institutions that mediate and contain value or economic conflicts.

## Promoting and inhibiting forces of social cohesion

### Socioeconomic domain

::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 100%;"}

* Economic inequality can be "corrosive" to social cohesion [@delhey_social_2023]. As individuals are set apart by economic distance this breeds greater social distance, reduce chances of encounter and knowing others' world views [@otero_lives_2022]. 

* Socioeconomic differences can draw symbolic boundaries of "respectability" and "distinction"[@groh-samberg_social_2023, p.315] associated with lower trust in others[@diprete_segregation_2011]. 

* Advantaged positions are associated with lower perceived risks in exchange situations, which would explain a greater willingness to trust others [@fiske_facing_2012]. 
  
* As cooperation partners, people with high SES (education and income) are perceived as more competent, in contrast to individuals with lower SES [@salgado_expectations_2021]

## Promoting and inhibiting forces of social cohesion

### Sociocultural diversity domain

::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 100%;"}
* Sociocultural **diversity** defined by differences in ethnic, religious, or national origin can tension social cohesion [@baldassarri_diversity_2020]. 
 
* Migrants may be perceived as an economic **threat**, associated with increased perceived labor or cultural competition, linked to the loss of national identity [@castillo_social_2023]. However, positive **contact experiences** are also linked to lower prejudge towards migrants [@hewstone_consequences_2015]

* Religiosisty can also be perceived as a symbol of adherence to social norms and values  [@rowatt_dimensions_2021]. Religious people may be perceived as slow planners, non-impulsive, and more trustworthy than non-religious people [@moon_religious_2018].

## Promoting and inhibiting forces of social cohesion

### Value domain

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 style="font-size: 80%;"}
* Societies with greater degree of shared values show higher levels of social trust, suggesting that common goals are promoted by similarity in human value orientation [@beilmann_social_2015].
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=2 style="font-size: 80%;"}
* They function as evaluation criteria, so certain value profiles can promote or inhibit cohesion [@groh-samberg_social_2023].

* Values transcend specific actions and situations. Distinguishing them from norms and attitudes that usually refer to specific actions, objects, or situations [@schwartz_universals_1992]

:::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3 style="font-size: 50%;"}

* According to the theory of basic human values [@schwartz_universals_1992], values can be divided into four conflicting higher-order values

## Promoting and inhibiting forces of social cohesion

### Political Domain

::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 100%"}

* Political positions affect social evaluations while political *identity* determines perceptions of trustworthiness and openness to reciprocity [@groh-samberg_social_2023]. 

* Political division highlights evaluations based on **group membership**. For example, individuals evaluate positions on a **left-right** spectrum that traces the identities of political groups [@hernandez-lagos_political_2020].

* In contrast to the borders of the political spectrum, **centrists** are often seen as more moderate, open to compromise, and less extremist, making them more accessible to people from diverse political backgrounds [@hernandez-lagos_political_2020]
