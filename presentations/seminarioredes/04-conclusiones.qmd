## Discussion and conclusions

:::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 110%;"}

* Socioeconomic differences show a pattern of distancing, particularly the withdrawal of individuals with low status from those with high status.

* Sociocultural diversity is less pronounced. Newcomers (migrants) tend to be less liked on average; however, this appears to be a relatively stable pattern across groups, with no clear evidence of homophily.

* Religious differences between believers and non-believers are more evident, especially between non-religious individuals and Christians, possibly reflecting a process of secular change (?).

* Political divides are noticeable: moderates are generally preferred over both extremes. 
  * Homophily is evident within political groups, is this some degree of polarization?

* Human values emerge as the strongest driver. 
  * Similarity in values is closely linked trustworthiness. Particularly for the those with "self-enhancement" as dominant value.
