# Methods {background-color="#491106ff"}

## Factorial survey experiment

* **Research design:** A vignette factorial study is used to explore how specific characteristics of fictional subjects (vignettes) influence the assessments of external observers.
  
* **Vignette design:**
  * Each vignette includes attributes such as demographic or socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., gender, income).
    
* Respondents evaluate these vignettes based on the attributes provided (***details on next slide***).
  
* **Administration:** To ensure manageable data collection, each respondent evaluates a **limited** number of vignettes.

</br>

* Factorial universe: 2x3x3x4x3x3x3x4x4 representing a factorial universe of 31,104 possible combinations (impossible to evaluate). 
  
* Two steps (D-efficient algorithm in SAS):
  
  * Optimal selection of vignettes (144)
  * Organized in blocks (15)
  * 9 to 10 vignettes per block

## Example 

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5; width: 90%; margin: auto;">

_Person [ID] is [**male**] and [**45 years old**]. He was [**born in Venezuela, came to Chile**], and is [**Catholic**]. Person A [**completed secondary education**], is [**employed full-time**], and has a monthly [**income of $4,100,000**] at his disposal. He considers himself politically [**left-wing**]. For Person A, [**it is important to make his own decisions and lead a fun and adventurous life**]._

</div>

### Outcomes

1) Imagine you meet a person [ID] through your circle of acquaintances. How likely is it that you will get along with the person [ID]?  [(**Trust**)]{.mark} 
2) Imagine you are faced with a task that you cannot do on your own. How likely are you to ask [ID] for help? (**Cooperation**)
3) Imagine that person [ID] moves into your neighborhood. What is the probability that you will come into conflict with that person? (**Conflict**)

## Methods

:::: {.incremental style="font-size: 75%;"}

**Mutilevel regression**:

The model is a two-level hierarchical linear model:

* **Level 1 (within respondents):** Observations are individual vignettes rated by respondents. Predictors at this level are vignette characteristics (e.g., vignette income).

* **Level 2 (between respondents):** Respondents are the higher-level units. Predictors at this level are respondent characteristics (e.g., respondent income, age, gender).

* **Cross-level interaction:** The effect of a vignette-level predictor (e.g., vignette income) is allowed to vary depending on a respondent-level predictor (e.g., respondent income). This is modeled by including an interaction term.
